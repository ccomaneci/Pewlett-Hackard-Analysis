# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## The Purpose
The Purpose of this analysis was to create data tables for the company Pewlett-Hackard to help them determine how many of their employees will soon be eligible for retirement. Of course, to determine this we needed to at multiple pieces of data which could in turn help us determine which department these employees work in and their titles within the company.

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company that has been around for years, currently they have 300,024 employees in their database. 72,458 of those employees, whose birth dates are between the years 1952 and 1955, are now eligible for retirement. Understanding data like this is helpful as it will allows the company to know how to prepare for the further of its employees[1]. Helping the existing employees transition into retirement and posting new job opening to help fill those positions once they become vacate. It also allows the company to see who would be able to become monitors to new and existing employees. 
We are also able to see the titles of the retirement eligible employees, this will allow Pewlett-Hackard to know which positions need to be posted. Majority of the titles are Senior Engineer with 25,916 current retirement eligible employees holding a position and Senior Staff with 24,926[1]. 

## Summary
We now know that 72.458 employees are eligible for retirement and of those 1549 are eligible to mentor the next generation of personnel. As the company prepares for these employees to transition into the next chapter of lives, they can also begin to organize filling those positions with new job postings.
